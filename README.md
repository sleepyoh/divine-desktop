# image-template

# Purpose

This repository is a custom build of Fedora silverblue, inspired originally by Bazzite, made possible by people from Ublue and Fedora.

# Goal

The goal is to have a costum image that does a few things different.

We add rpmfusion and replace mesa with mesa-freeworld, we add ffmpeg and lots of codecs. 

All flatpaks from Fedora are replaced with flatpaks from Flathub. 

We install things such as libvirt, distrobox, fastfetch, tmux, and some other nice to have stuff.

This Readme is not finished and just a 1 minute throw together. TODO!
